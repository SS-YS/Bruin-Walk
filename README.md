# Bruin Walk

Welcome to Bruin Walk, a 3D WebGL endless road crossing game inspired by Crossy Road. Designed specifically for UCLA students, this game captures the everyday challenge of navigating the bustling Bruin Walk area to get to class on time. Your goal is to guide a Bruin character across the busy roads,  avoiding scooters that intermittently block the way. Your final score will be calculated based on how far you get.

We used [tiny-graphics-js](https://github.com/encyclopedia-of-code/tiny-graphics-js), a JavaScript library that refractors common WebGL steps such as vector mathematics and matrix transformations, to build this game.

## Run
1. Clone or download this repository. <br>
2. Run a fake server by opening 'host.bat' if you're using Windows, or 'host.command' if you're using MacOS. On MacOS, you might get a security warning. If so, open the terminal, navigate to the directory, run ```chmod u+x host.command```, and then open 'host.command' again. <br>
3. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8200/. 

## Controls
The keyboard controls are simple and intuitive. You may use the 'w' key to move forward, the 's' key to move back, the 'a' key to move left, and the 'd' key to move right.

## Future Extensions
- Add skateboarders and football players to block the roads. <br>
- Design a real-world mapping to Bruin Walk, with buildings such as Pauley Pavilion and John Wooden Center.
